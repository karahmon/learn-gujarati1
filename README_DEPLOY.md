Deployment and setup notes

1) Install dependencies (locally or CI):

```bash
npm install
```

2) Build (locally to test):

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

3) Tailwind + PostCSS
- We now build Tailwind during `vite build` using `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`.
- Ensure `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` are installed (they're listed in `devDependencies`).

4) Firebase env vars (Vercel):
- Add these environment variables to your Vercel project (Settings â†’ Environment Variables):
  - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
  - VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
  - VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
  - VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
  - VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
  - VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID

5) Notes on production readiness:
- Do NOT use `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` in production. Tailwind is compiled into your CSS during the build.
- Do not commit real env vars to git; use Vercel's environment variable settings.

6) If you see blank pages after deploy:
- Check Vercel build logs for PostCSS/Tailwind errors.
- Confirm environment variables are set in Vercel and redeploy.
