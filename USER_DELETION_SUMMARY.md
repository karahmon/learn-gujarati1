## 🎯 User Experience

### With Cloud Functions:
```
Admin clicks Delete
    ↓
Confirmation dialog: "Delete from both Firestore AND Auth?"
    ↓
User clicks OK
    ↓
Cloud Function executes
    ↓
✅ Success: "User completely deleted!"
    ↓
User removed from:
  - Firestore ✅
  - Firebase Authentication ✅
```

### Without Cloud Functions:
```
Admin clicks Delete
    ↓
Confirmation: "Delete from Firestore? (Auth requires manual step)"
    ↓
User clicks OK
    ↓
Firestore deletion + Request created
    ↓
⚠️ Message: "Deleted from DB. To complete, delete from Firebase Console"
    ↓
User removed from:
  - Firestore ✅
  - Firebase Authentication ❌ (manual step needed)
```

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Only Super Admins can delete users (checked in Cloud Function)
- ✅ All deletions logged with admin UID and timestamp
- ✅ Deletion requests stored in Firestore for audit trail
- ✅ Cloud Functions validate permissions before deletion
- ✅ Firestore rules prevent unauthorized deletion requests

---

## 💰 Cost

**Cloud Functions:**
- Free tier: 2,000,000 invocations/month
- Deleting 1000 users/month = 1000 invocations
- **Cost: $0** (well within free tier)

**Blaze Plan:**
- Required for Cloud Functions
- Only pay for what you use
- Set spending limits to prevent surprises
- For small apps: typically $0/month

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "functions/not-found"
→ Cloud Functions not deployed. Run: `firebase deploy --only functions`

### "permission-denied"
→ Not logged in as Super Admin. Check Firestore role field.

### "Build failed"
→ Check Node.js version (need 18+). Reinstall dependencies.

### Functions deployed but not working
→ Check Firebase Console → Functions → Logs for errors
