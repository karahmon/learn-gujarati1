# 🚀 QUICK FIX: Failed to Fetch Users Error

## The Problem
You're seeing "Failed to fetch users" because Firestore security rules are blocking access.

## ⚡ FASTEST Solution (Manual - 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Click **Firestore Database** in the left menu
4. Click **Rules** tab at the top

### Step 2: Replace the Rules
Copy EVERYTHING from the `firestore.rules` file in this project and paste it into the Firebase Console rules editor, then click **Publish**.

Or use these rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    function isSignedIn() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    function getUserData() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data;
    }
    
    function isSuperAdmin() {
      return isSignedIn() && getUserData().role == 'Super Admin';
    }
    
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn() && (request.auth.uid == userId || isSuperAdmin());
      allow create: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow update: if (isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == userId) || isSuperAdmin();
      allow delete: if isSuperAdmin();
    }
    
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Make Yourself Super Admin

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Copy your User UID (long string like `xYz123...`)
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **users** collection
4. Find your user document (should match your UID)
5. Click on your document
6. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
7. Add/Update these fields:
   - `role`: `Super Admin` (exactly like this, with capital S and A)
   - `approvalStatus`: `approved`
8. Click **Update**

### Step 4: Refresh Your App

1. Go back to your app (localhost:3000)
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
3. If still logged in, try logging out and back in
4. You should now see the Role Management page with all users!

## 🔧 Alternative: Using Firebase CLI (Recommended for Production)

### Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

### Initialize Firebase (if not done)

```bash
firebase init firestore
```

Select:
- Use an existing project
- Choose your project
- Accept default file names

### Deploy Rules

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🧪 Testing

After deploying rules:

1. **Login as Super Admin** (the account you just updated)
2. Go to **Role Management** page
3. You should see all users in a table with stats

If you still see "Failed to fetch users":
- Check browser console (F12) for detailed error
- Verify your role is exactly `Super Admin` in Firestore
- Make sure you hard-refreshed the page

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check browser console**: Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
2. **Check Firestore rules logs**: Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Logs
3. **Verify your user document**: Make sure `role` field is exactly `"Super Admin"`
4. **Try incognito window**: Sometimes cached data causes issues

Common mistakes:
- ❌ Role is `"super admin"` instead of `"Super Admin"` (case sensitive!)
- ❌ Forgot to refresh after updating Firestore
- ❌ Not logged in as the user you updated
- ❌ Security rules not published
